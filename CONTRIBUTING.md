# How to Contribute

The purpose of the [Participatory Orgs Project](https://github.com/ParticipatoryOrgs) is to increase the participation of stakeholders in organizations by sharing a curated set of opinionated Free Cultural Works documents that support participatory organizations, including legal, governance, best practices, and even code.

Our desire is to apply these principles to our own work. Thus enabling third-party contributions to the Project and our repositories is essential for keeping the Participatory Orgs Project great.

We want to keep this process as easy as possible, but there are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can maintain quality and have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).

## Trivial Changes

For changes of a trivial nature in an existing repository document:

* Go to the issues page in that repository and see if anyone else has suggested similar changes. If yes, add a comment showing your support. Otherwise, submit a new ticket in that repository clearly describing your changes. Your ticket will be reviewed by the appropriate team circle, and if there are no objections add them to the project.

## Substantial Changes

For more substantial changes an existing repository document or if you wish to add files to the repository: 
* Sign the [Contributor License Agreement]( ) in the [Participatory Orgs Community](https://github.com/ParticipatoryOrgs/ParticipatoryOrgs-Community).
* Go to the issues page in that repository and see if anyone else is suggesting similar changes. If yes, add a comment showing your support. Otherwise, submit a new ticket in that repository clearly describing your changes. Then...
  * Fork the repository on GitHub
  * In your fork, make your changes (typically in your master branch).
  * In your commit, write a succinct <40 character summary of your changes, referencing the issue you created, for example "Added new section per #3"), add more details in the extended description.
  * If you are using Github interface, before committing review your changes with the Preview tab. Then commit your changes.
  * Go to the master repository, and submit a pull request for your changes.
  * The appropriate circle team will review your ticket and pull request, and if there are no objections add it to the project. If the circle does not accept the pull request, they may leave the ticket open to request community discussion, or offer feedback as to how to revise the request to have it accepted. After feedback has been offered the circle expects response from the submitter within two weeks. After two weeks they may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## New Repositories

If would like to submit a new repository into the project:
* Go to the [Participatory Orgs Community](https://github.com/ParticipatoryOrgs/ParticipatoryOrgs-Community) repository's [Issues](issues) page and see if anyone else is suggesting similar documents. If there are not, then...
  * Create a repository in your own account in GitHub, with a LICENSE file with an appropriate open source agreement (we prefer CC-BY).
  * Create a new ticket in the [Participatory Orgs Community](https://github.com/ParticipatoryOrgs/ParticipatoryOrgs-Community) repository's [Issues](issues) that references your repository and clearly describe its purpose and contents.
  * The appropate circle team will review your ticket, and if there are no objections they will fork the repository into the project, and our version of the project will be listed as a fork of your project. If the circle does not accept the pull request, they may leave the ticket open to request community discussion, or offer feedback as to how to revise the request to have it accepted. After feedback has been offered the circle expects response from the submitter within two weeks. After two weeks they may close ticket if it isn't showing any activity.
